# Rachel Normand
_Experienced software engineer and leader focused on building great products and high performing teams, as well as fostering a remote-first culture._

## About me
I've been a software engineer for nine years, working across a range of domains and technologies. Most recently I've been building full stack Node.js microservices to help teachers and schools at Tes. In the last year I've been leading teams of four to seven engineers working across multiple locations and timezones. I've helped to build a remote-first culture through mentoring and coaching individuals and teams. I'm happiest helping teams work together and building great products.

## Employment History

### Principal Engineer, Tes Global
_Feb 2016 - present_

I lead remote-first teams of software engineers building products to help schools recruit teachers. We build full-stack microservices in Nodejs and React across a range of products that help teachers apply for jobs and schools find the right teachers.

My job includes:
- mentoring and helping individuals to be more effective through pairing and coaching
- helping teams work better together across multiple locations and timezones
- collaborating with product owners to plan and specify work and advocating a lean approach to product development to get products in front of users quickly
- working with high-risk and special category and considering risk in everything we do
- designing and implementing scalable microservices
- working with other Principal Engineers to lead technology choices and share ways of working
- helping to define an engineering career ladder for the engineering team

### Consultant, Thoughtworks
_March 2014 - Feb 2016_

I was a consultant developer on the following projects:

* #### METRO, Salesforce App
  Part of a team in Hamburg and Dusseldorf developing a web application for METRO Sales Managers to plan and manage customer visits. The system consists of a Java backend with a Cassandra database and a front end React service. I was also personally resonsible for the deployment pipeline of the application to Google Cloud using Kubernetes and Docker.

* #### GOV UK Verify, Government Digital Service
  I worked on the GOV UK Verify project which provides a single, secure way for individuals to access government services online. The system consists of numerous microservices written in Java using the Dropwizard framework. To ensure security, messages between these microservices and external systems use SAML.

  This involves working in a support role for one week every month. This includes speaking with different third parties, releasing to test and production environments daily, and solving problems that arise in production.

* #### Identity Assurance for Organisations and Agents Alpha, Government Digital Service
  I worked on a small team at the Government Digital Service to build a prototype in Clojure to investigate a single sign-in service for the government for businesses. This included investigating the OpenID Connect protocol and implementing this in Clojure. I gave a talk about this project at the Clojure Xchange conference in December 2014.

### Software Developer, Sky Network Services
_July 2011 - March 2014_

I was part of a team that interfaced with BT to provide telephone and broadband services to Sky customers. Development was mainly in Java writing to an Oracle database and communicating using XML via an ActiveMQ message broker. I worked on a mixture of legacy systems using Spring and Hibernate, and newer, more lightweight systems designed around business events. I enjoyed using functional libraries such as Guava and Totally Lazy to make transforming collections simple and elegant. I also developed a small Scala application, and found Scala’s support for overloading operators to be perfect for creating a simple DSL to route messages.

This was an Agile environment: pair programming was standard, using a test driven development approach and starting from an acceptance test to define the business requirement. I led numerous retrospectives for other teams and believe that effective communication is key to making a team work well.

### Technology Graduate, BSkyB
_July 2009 - July 2011_

Two year graduate scheme consisting of a six week intensive training course on all areas of the software lifecycle and four six month placements in various technology departments. This included:

* #### Agile Software Developer, Sky Network Services
  Designing, testing, developing and delivering software using a variety of languages and frameworks, using agile programming techniques.

* #### Test Analyst, Sky Network Services
  Acceptance and performance testing applications, developing test scripts and providing quality assurance, using Concordion and Yatspec test frameworks.

* #### Configuration Analyst, Infrastructure Services
  Analysing infrastructure and using a Remedy CMDB. Introduced a team wiki and Agile Ops to the team.

* #### Agile Web Developer, Innovations Team
  Front end web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery. Some back end development using PHP and Wordpress. Agile environment with small projects and weekly iterations.
